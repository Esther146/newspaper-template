            <h4><i>"The css grid layout module, Basic Concept of grid layout"</i></h4>
            <p>CSS Grid Layout introduces a two-dimensional grid system to CSS.
                Grids can be used to lay out major page areas or small user interface elements. 
                This article introduces the CSS Grid Layout and the new 
                terminology that is part of the CSS Grid Layout Level 1 specification.
                The features shown in this overview will then be explained in greater 
                detail in the rest of this guide.We define rows and columns on our grid with 
                the grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows properties. These define grid tracks.
                A grid track is the space between any 
                two lines on the grid. In the below image you can see a track highlighted – this is the
                first row track in our grid.In this final example, we mix absolute sized tracks with fr units.
                The first track is 500 pixels, so the fixed width is taken away from the available space. 
                The remaining space is divided into three and assigned in proportion to the two flexible tracks.
                When creating our example grid we specifically defined our column tracks with the grid-template-columns property,
                but the grid also created rows on its own. These rows are part of the implicit grid. Whereas the
                explicit grid consists of any rows and columns defined with grid-template-columns or grid-template-rows.
                If you place something outside of the defined grid—or due to the amount of content, more grid tracks 
                are needed—then the grid creates rows and columns in the implicit grid. These tracks will be auto-sized by default, 
                resulting in their size being based on the content that is inside them.
                You can also define a set size for tracks created in the implicit grid with the grid-auto-rows and grid-auto-columns properties.
                In the below example we use grid-auto-rows to ensure that tracks created in the implicit grid are 200 pixels tall.
            </p>
            
            <h4><i>"What is a grid? Fixed and flexible track sizes"</i></h4>
            <p>A grid is a set of intersecting horizontal and vertical lines defining columns and rows.
               Elements can be placed onto the grid within these  column and row lines. 
               CSS grid layout has the following features: You can create a grid with fixed 
               track sizes – using pixels for example.
               This sets the grid to the specified pixel which fits to the layout you desire.
               You can also create a grid using flexible sizes with 
               percentages or with the new fr unit designed for this purpose.
               All the direct children are now grid items. In a web browser, you won't
               see any difference to how these items are displayed before turning
               them into a grid, as grid has created a single column grid for the items. 
               At this point, you may find it useful to work with the Grid Inspector,
              available as part of Firefox's Developer Tools. If you view this example
              in Firefox and inspect the grid, you will see a small icon next to the
              value grid. Click this and then the grid on this element will be overlaid in the browser window.

            <p>You can place items into a precise location on the grid using line
               numbers, names or by targeting an area of the grid. Grid also contains
                an algorithm to control the placement of items not given an explicit position on the grid.</p>

        <section class="more-explanation">
                You can define an explicit grid with grid layout. The Grid Layout
                specification is flexible enough to add additional rows and columns
                when needed. 
                Features such as adding "as many columns that will fit into a container" are included.
